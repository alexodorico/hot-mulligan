# Hot Mulligan Website

### About 
This was the first website I built in August 2016. They gave me complete freedom with the website, and even looking back I'm pretty happy with it. The band has since signed to a record label and they now manage their web presence for them, which resulted in them getting a new site. The old website can be seen [here](hot-mulligan.firebaseapp.com).

### What I Learned
* Using & compiling SCSS
* How to work with SVG
* How to use a CSS Framework
* Basics of responsive design

### Looking Back
* I would have definitely used some sort of CMS. It was a pain updating the concert listing whenever they booked a new show.
* Not happy with the hover effect on the show listings
* I wish I would have used source control
